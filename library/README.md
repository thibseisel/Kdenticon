# KDenticon

KDenticon is a Java library for generating highly recognizable identicons.
Written in Kotlin, it is a port of [Jdenticon](https://github.com/dmester/jdenticon) to the JVM platform.

## Purpose

An Identicon is a visual representation of a hash value, usually of an IP address, that serves to identify 
a user of a computer system as a form of avatar while protecting the users' privacy.

You may also use those icons in any other context, for example as a placeholder image.

## Note about the author

I do not own the original idea. If you like the look of the icons, consider leaving a tip to the original author,
